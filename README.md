[WIP]Stochastic Differential Equation Simulator

A work in progress Rust-based simulator for providing a simulator for solving Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) using different methods.

The project supports intended to simulate common models like Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and custom SDEs defined by the user.
